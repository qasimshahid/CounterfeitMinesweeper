# Counterfeit Minesweeper
A recreation of the popular game Minesweeper. 

# How to Play
1. Download the zip file.
2. Extract the zip file in the directory where it was installed.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the src folder. (~\Counterfeit-Minesweeper-main\Counterfeit-Minesweeper-main\src)
4. Ensure Java JDK Verison 8 or above is installed. Using the terminal, type this command to compile all .java files: "javac *.java"
5. Once files have been compiled, you can play the game by typing "java Play config1"

If that configuration was way too easy for you, you can edit the number of mines and the board size by using a text editor (Notepad should do fine)
to edit the content within the "config1" file. 

Thanks for taking the time to check out my first ever GitHub repo! :)
