# Counterfeit Minesweeper
A recreation of the popular game Minesweeper. Originally a class project made during my second semester at college. GUI frame and MouseReader elements were written by my professors. The rest was coded by me. This project does not utilize any inheritance or polymorphism by design. Utilizes the Object class and (many) typecasts to place an emphasis on the importance of the Object class within Java (which serves as the "daddy" of all classes), and how it allows us to generalize data. 

# How to Play
1. Download the zip file.
2. Extract the zip file in the directory where it was installed.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the src folder. (~\Counterfeit-Minesweeper-main\Counterfeit-Minesweeper-main\src)
4. Ensure Java JDK Version 8 or above is installed. Using the terminal, type this command to compile all .java files: "javac *.java"
5. Once files have been compiled, you can play the game by typing "java Play config1"

If that configuration was way too easy for you, you can edit the number of mines and the board size by using a text editor (Notepad should be fine)
to edit the content within the "config1" file. 

Thanks for taking the time to check out my first ever GitHub repo! :)
